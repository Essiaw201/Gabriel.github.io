                    <p> Want some news about GTA 5? The highly-anticipated sequel to one of most successful games of all time has a lot to live up to. GTA 5 sold nearly 110 million copies and crashed the Epic Game Store when it was given out as a weekly freebie, but there's still no official news as to what exactly the sequel is and when we can get it.</p> 
                    <p>Fans of the series have had to subsist on rumors until now and tide themselves over playing the recent GTA Remastered Trilogy, even if it did    turn out to be a bit of a trainwreck at launch.Even for casual gamers, the name Grand Theft Auto rings a bell. The franchise certainly has a legacy, and likely lives in infamy amongst parents.</p> 
                    <p>That doesn't mean it isn't successful though, as the franchise is one of the biggest in all the gaming industry.Even for casual gamers, the name Grand Theft Auto rings a bell.

                <p>I think it is important to be able to experience the excitement and sense of accomplishment that football has, in the game. Not to mention being able to play games in photorealism…The performance of PS5 is incredible, and while benefiting from it, we have faced many challenges and feel that we are steadily approaching ‘the next level’ step. However, no matter how good the performance of PS5 is, there are various restrictions to be noted above.</p>

                <p>Far Cry is a franchise all about iconic villains, chilling but unique atmosphere, and its overarching themes of "insanity." At least it has been since Far Cry 3 and arguably earlier, but Far Cry 5 seemed to ignore much of the atmospheric elements of past games.</p> <p>The fifth entry has all the staples of a proper Far Cry game, and yet, the gameplay experience is far more stereotypical and silly compared to past Far Cry games.</p> <p>The villain's screen time is split into thirds among his three "apostles" sub-villains, and the game never really takes its narrative or atmosphere seriously.</p>
