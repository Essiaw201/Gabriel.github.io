            <p>This is the game that got me into racing games, 10 years ago. I was at a friend's house and he was playing it, I thought it was so realistic. A month later, my father bought me a PS2. I didn't buy the game straight away - maybe 2 years later -, but it's still one of my favorites along with Most Wanted.</p>

            <p>Mortal Kombat 11 Ultimate, then, is obviously aimed at those who are yet to jump into the world of Mortal Kombat 11. Though it’s also a good pick up for those who own the base game and haven’t yet picked up any DLC for it yet despite intending to do so. After all, it’s cheaper than buying all the DLC separately.</p>

        <p>Tormented Souls is a horror game that harks back to the older survival horror titles that first made a big splash on the PS2 and Xbox. Those games made the most of fixed camera angles, weak protagonists, and limited inventories.</p>

        <p>Slaughter Race is an extremely gritty racing game that is played by multiple people controlling the racers. Its setting could be described as apocalyptic, due to the "style" of its rundown city, the orange-yellow color of its air and "sky" presumably from the exhaust, and the dangerous obstacles that its inhabitants face on a daily basis.</p>
